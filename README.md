I developed an interactive mobile application using .NET MAUI as the front-end technology. The application communicates with an AX server via RESTful Web APIs. This project has been developed for PET, a subsidiary of a German E-T-A company for manufacturing electronical sub pieces, based in Akouda, Tunisia. 
I was responsible for designing and implementing the mobile app's user interface, conducting usability testing in collaboration with the backend Ax Server, and communicating with customers to gather feedback for UI improvements. I also managed the final installation and deployment of the app on three CK-65 Honeywell devices on-site.
